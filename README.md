The project aims to solve the problems of inaccurate calorie tracking and overwhelming user interfaces commonly found in fitness apps like MyFitnessPal and Lose It! These issues make it difficult for users to consistently track their calorie intake and meet their dietary or fitness goals. The proposed solution focuses on providing a simplified, user-friendly app with a clean interface, a highly accurate and verified food database, and barcode scanning to streamline food logging.

The expected user experience revolves around simplicity, ease of use, and accuracy.

Key Design Elements:
User Onboarding: During signup, users input basic information such as age, weight, goals, and gender. This helps personalize their experience and tailor recommendations.

Tracking Diet: The app provides a simple interface to log daily meals. Users can manually input food or use the barcode scanner for quick, accurate tracking of calories and macros, pulling data from a verified database.

Fitness Plan Integration: The app offers fitness plan tracking where users can log workouts and track progress in alignment with their dietary goals.

Minimalist UI: The interface is designed to be clean and intuitive, reducing clutter and focusing on essential elements like progress visuals, meal logging, and daily goals.

These design choices ensure users can easily track both their fitness and dietary progress without feeling overwhelmed by unnecessary complexity.
